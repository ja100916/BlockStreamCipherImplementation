# Block and Stream Cipher Implementation

> **A C++ implementation of block and stream cipher operations with educational focus**

## Overview

🔒 **Core Features:**
* 16-byte block cipher implementation
* Continuous stream cipher operations
* Modern C++17 with RAII principles
* Comprehensive test suite

## Technical Implementation

**Block Cipher:**
* Fixed 16-byte block processing
* Custom 0x81 padding mechanism
* Key-based byte swapping
* Separate encryption/decryption paths

**Stream Cipher:**
* Byte-level XOR operations
* Continuous key stream application
* Cyclic key reuse
* Bidirectional operation support

## Performance & Security

⚡ **Optimizations:**
* Efficient memory management
* Buffered I/O operations
* Streamlined data processing
* Smart key handling
